## Library Project - TOP

In this project, We will make a library website where we can save the books that we read or have not read yet. We can also change the read status of the book and remove it if you want to. This website is integrated with a database so you won't lose the informations that you have. However, it is not tailored to person to person yet so that can be improved for later on.

## Conclusion

There was a lot of googling to make this works, but what's important is I got it worked. 

And there's an advice to remember from a TOP member says that if you try to understand the concept you've just learned perfectly, it wouldn't really work well because you don't see the use of it yet. Therefore it might be better you try to understand it using over and over so you see the use of it, and then try to understand the concept deeply!
